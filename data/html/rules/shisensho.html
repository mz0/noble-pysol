<h1>Shisen-Sho</h1>
<p>Shisen-Sho is a single-player-game similar to Mahjongg and uses
the same set of tiles as Mahjongg.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>The object of the game is to remove all tiles from the
field.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>The aim of the game is to remove all tiles from the board. Only
two matching tiles can be removed at a time. Two tiles can only be
removed if they can be connected with a maximum of three connected
lines. Lines can be horizontal or vertical, but not diagonal.</p>
<p>You don't have to draw the lines by yourself, the game does this
for you. Just mark two matching tiles on the board, if they can be
connected with a maximum of three lines, the lines will be drawn
and the tiles are removed.</p>
<p>Remember that lines only may cross the empty border. If you are
stuck, you can use the Hint feature to find two tiles which may be
removed. Clicking a tile with the right mouse button will show you
all corresponding tiles, no matter if they are removable at the
moment or not.</p>
