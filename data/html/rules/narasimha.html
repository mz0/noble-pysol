<h1>Narasimha</h1>
Dashavatara Ganjifa type. One deck. No redeal.
<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the foundations.
<h3>Quick description</h3>
Play is similar to <a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a>. The rows
build down by rank in "alternate" colors.
<h3>Rules</h3>
The cards on the tableau build down in rank in alternate colors.
The Dashavatara Ganjifa deck has ten suits and each suit has it's
own color. This makes it a bit problematic at times knowing which
colors are alternate. If a card of one suit doesn't play in a spot,
try a different card of the same rank. The foundations build up in
rank by suit starting with the Ace. The cards are dealt from the
talon one at a time. There is no redeal. Only the Mirs (Kings) may
be played on an empty row. Cards may be played from the
foundations.
<h3>Strategy</h3>
The waste stack will be the biggest problem area. Play from it
first.
