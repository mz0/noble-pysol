<h1>Contradance</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>Contradance (also known as Cotillion) is a solitaire card game
which is played with two decks of playing cards. It is probably so
called because when the game is won, it shows the king and the
queen of each suit about to do a dance. It should not be confused
with another solitaire game of Royal Cotillion.</p>
<p>Before the game starts, all fives and sixes are separated from
the shuffled decks and placed on the table. These sixteen cards are
the foundations; the fives are built down to aces, then kings,
while the sixes are built up to queens, all by suit.</p>
<p>The stock is dealt one at a time, and cards that cannot be built
yet on the foundations are placed on a wastepile, the top card of
which is available for play on the foundations. The predominant
rule sets allow only one redeal. To do this, the unplayed cards on
the wastepile are picked up and turned face down to make the new
stock.</p>
<p>The game is won when all cards are built on the foundations.</p>
