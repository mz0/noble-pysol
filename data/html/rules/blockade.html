<h1>Blockade</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>Blockade is a solitaire card game which uses two decks of 52
playing cards each. Akin to solitaire games like Klondike and
Gargantua, the object of the game is play the cards into the eight
foundations.</p>
<p>The game starts with twelve piles, each containing a card (the
rest form the stock). Cards are built down by suit (e.g., 7-6-5-4)
and cards or groups of cards can be moved from one pile to another
or to the foundations. The foundations are built up also by suit,
starting from the ace. An empty pile will be filled up immediately
by a card from the stock.</p>
<p>When all possible moves are done without success, a card is
dealt onto each pile, even with those that have sequences. This and
the placing of cards on empty piles is done until the stock runs
out. After that, any card or group of cards can be placed on any
empty space.</p>
<p>The game is won when all 104 cards are successfully moved to the
foundations.</p>
