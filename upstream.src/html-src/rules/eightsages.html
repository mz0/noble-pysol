<h1>Eight Sages</h1>
<p>
Klondike type. 2 decks. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of eight tableau piles.  Tableau
piles are built down by alternate color.  Cards cannot be
moved between tableau piles - only cards from the waste
pile can be moved to the tableau.  Empty tableau piles can
be filled with any card from the waste pile.
<p>
Deal cards from the talon one at a time, and these cards
can be moved to the tableau or foundation.  One redeal is
allowed, so you can go through the deck twice.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit from ace to king.
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
