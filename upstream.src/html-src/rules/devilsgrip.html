<h1>Devil's Grip</h1>
<p>
Picture Gallery type. 2 decks. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Devil's Grip is played without the aces.  Single cards are dealt to
three rows of eight cards each.
<p>
The rows are built up in same suit by threes, so in sequences of the
following:
<ul>
<li>2-5-8-Jack
<li>3-6-9-Queen
<li>4-7-10-King
</ul>
<p>
Sequences starting in a two must be in the top row, sequences starting
with a three must be in the middle row, and sequences starting with a
four must be in the bottom row.  You may start building sequences even
if they are in the wrong row, but they must ultimately be moved to the
correct row to win the game.
<p>
Any card or valid sequence of cards can be moved between piles.  Piles
may be switched with each other in order to get a sequence starting with
a 2, 3, or 4 into the correct row.  Empty piles are immediately filled
from the waste or talon (this is the only way the remaining 2s, 3s, and 4s
can be moved into the rows).
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal cards from the talon three at
a time, and move the top card to appropriate row piles.  You can deal through
the deck as many times as needed.
<p>
The game is won if you're able to move all cards to the rows, and all the
piles are placed correctly.
