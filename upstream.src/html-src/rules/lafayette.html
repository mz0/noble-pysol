<p>
Canfield type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of four tableau piles, and
thirteen cards are dealt to a reserve pile, arranged
so all cards are visible.
<p>
The tableau piles are built down by alternate color.
Any card or valid sequence of cards can be moved
between piles.  Empty tableau piles are immediately
filled from the top card of the reserve.  If the reserve
is empty, only sevens or sequences of cards starting with
a seven can be moved to tableau piles.  You can also move
cards from the top of the reserve to the tableau or
foundations.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can draw cards from the
talon three at a time, and move them to the tableau or
reserve.  You can go through the deck as many times as needed.
<p>
There are eight foundations.  Four are built up by suit
from ace to king, and the other four are built down from
king to ace.  The game is won if all cards are moved to
the foundations - it doesn't matter how many cards are in
each foundation.
