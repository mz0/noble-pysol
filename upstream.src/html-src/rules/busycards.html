An ace and a king of each suit is dealt to the foundations, and
the remaining cards are dealt to twelve piles of eight cards each.
Tableau piles are built up or down by same suit, and only single
cards can be moved between tableau piles.  Any card can fill empty
tableau piles.
<p>
There are six free cells, one located above each pair of tableau
piles.  Any single card can be moved to these free cells, but a card
can only be moved from the free cells if both of the tableau piles
under the cell are empty.

The foundations with aces are built up by same suit from ace to king,
and the foundations with kings are built down by same suit from king
to ace.
