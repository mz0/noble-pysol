Golf type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the single foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The cards are dealt to eight tableau piles, four with
six cards and four with seven.  No building on the tableau is
allowed.  The foundation is built up by rank, regardless of suit,
wrapping from ace to king as needed.  Any card can be used to start
the foundation.
<p>
Move cards one at a time from the tableau to the foundation in
sequence.  There are four free cells.  Cards from the tableau can be
moved to them, but from the free cells, they can only be moved to the
foundation later.  The game is won if all the cards can be moved to
the foundation in a single continuous sequence.
