<h1>Napoleon's Tomb</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time, and can
be moved to foundations, or one of four free cells.  There
are four foundations, built up from seven to king by rank,
regardless of suit, located in the corners, and a fifth
foundation, built down from six to ace by rank, regardless
of suit, then wrapping from ace to six, with the sequence
ultimately being built four times in a row.
<p>
The four free cells are located directly above, below, and
to the left and right of the center foundation.  These can
contain a single card, and can only be moved to the
foundations.  No redeal is allowed.  The game is won if all
cards are moved to the foundations.
