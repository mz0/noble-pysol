<h1>Cruel</h1>
<p>
Baker's Dozen type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Twelve tableau piles of four cards are dealt and the aces are moved to the
foundations at the start of the game.
<p>
The tableau piles build down by suit, and the foundations build up by
suit.  Only one card can be moved at a time, and empty spaces cannot be
filled.
<p>
When no more moves are possible click on the talon for a redeal.
The cards are not re-shuffled, but re-dealt in packs of 4 cards.  Note
that due to the way redealing is done, if no cards have been moved since
the last redeal, the cards will end up in the same layout as before.
This usually means the game is lost.
