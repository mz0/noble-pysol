<h1>Precedence</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
At the start of the game, one king is moved to the leftmost
of eight foundations.
<p>
Deal cards from the stock one at a time.  Cards from the waste
pile may be moved to foundations, which are built down by rank,
wrapping down from ace to king as necessary.  A card cannot be
placed in a foundation unless the foundation to the left of it
has cards in it.
<p>
The leftmost foundation starts with a king, and each foundation
starts with one rank lower than the one to the left of it.  Therefore,
the foundations begin with K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6 from left to right, and
are built to A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7 respectively.
<p>
You can go through the talon three times.  The game is won if
all cards are moved to the foundations.
