<h1>Gate</h1>
<p>
Canfield type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Five cards are dealt to each of two reserve piles, called the
"gate-posts".  A single card is dealt to each of eight tableau
piles, called the "rails".  The rails/tableau piles are built
down by alternate color, and any card or valid sequence can be
moved between them.  Cards from the gate-posts can also be moved
to the tableau or foundations.
<p>
Empty tableau piles are immediately filled from one of the
gate-posts (whichever has more cards), or the waste pile if both
are empty.
<p>
Draw cards from the talon one at a time, and can be moved to the
foundations or tableau.  No redeal is allowed.  The foundations
are built up by same suit from ace to king, and the game is won
when all cards are moved to the foundations.
