<h1>Free Ishido Relaxed</h1>
<p>
Ishido game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all tiles to the playing area.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href='ishido.html'>Ishido</a>, but tiles do not need to be
placed adjacent to other tiles, and there are no restrictions
when placing a tile next to two or more other tiles - they just have
to match the color or symbol of each.
