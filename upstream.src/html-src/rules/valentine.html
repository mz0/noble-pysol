<h1>Valentine</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Organize all cards in four columns with complete same suit sequences
from king to ace.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of four piles.  A single card is dealt to a
waste pile.  Cards can be moved to the four piles, building down by
same suit.  If a pile is empty, it is filled by the card on the waste.
<p>
Only a single card can be in the waste pile at a time.  If there are
no more moves, you can place the four tableau piles at the bottom of
the deck, without shuffling them, then move the waste card to one of
the piles, and deal a single card from the stock to the other three.
<p>
As play continues, the cards will slowly move into sequence.  The
game is won if all the cards can be organized into four same suit
columns.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Valentine is a game of pure luck.  It was mostly designed as a way to
kill time.
