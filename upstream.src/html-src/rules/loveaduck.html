<h1>Love a Duck</h1>
<p>
Yukon type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The tableau piles are built in a pyramid-esque layout, with eleven cards
in the top layer, ten cards in the middle, and nine on the bottom.
The remaining cards are dealt out to the top layer.  Each card forms a
tableau pile which can be built down by alternate color, but cards can be
moved regardless of sequence.  The bottom layer cards can be filled with
a king when empty, but the remaining layers cannot be filled.
<p>
Though all cards are dealt face-up, cards in the lower layers cannot
be moved until the cards on top of them are moved.  However, if the
only card or sequence overlapping a card can legally be played on it,
that sequence can be moved down in a dropdown move.
<p>
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.  The game is won when
all cards are moved to the foundations.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Love a Duck was invented by Jan Wolter, and first appeared in his app
<a href="https://politaire.com">Politaire</a>.  The name came from
"Lord Love a Duck", an expression of surprise from early 1900s London.
