<h1>Lanes</h1>
<p>
Klondike type. 1 deck. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to six piles of three cards each and the aces
are dealt to the foundations.  Tableau piles are built down
by alternate color, and only single cards can be moved between
tableau piles.  Any card can fill empty tableau piles.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal cards from the talon
one at a time, and move them to the tableau or foundations if
possible.  You are allowed one redeal, so you can go through
the deck twice.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit.  The game is won if
all cards are moved to the foundations.
