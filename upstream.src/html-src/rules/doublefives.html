<h1>Double Fives</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
All of the cards in one of two decks are dealt out to ten
tableau piles of five cards each, with the last two cards
put aside as reserve cards.  The second deck is used as the
talon.  Tableau piles are built down by same suit, and only
single cards can be moved between tableau piles.  The reserve
cards can be moved to the foundations or tableau at any time.
<p>
When there are no moves left, five cards are dealt from the
talon.  Any of these five cards can be moved to the tableau or
foundations.  If there are no more moves, the remaining of these
five cards are placed aside, and five new cards are dealt.  This
continues until the talon is empty.
<p>
A single redeal is allowed.  During this redeal, the cards set
aside are used to form a new talon, and these cards are dealt
one at a time (in the normal manner), and can be moved to the
tableau or foundations.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit from ace to king.  The
game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
