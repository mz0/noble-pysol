<h1>Roaming Proils</h1>
<p>
Fan game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt into 17 piles of three cards each, with only the
top card of each pile face-up.  The final card is dealt to a
single reserve pile.
<p>
Tableau piles are built by same rank, but only three consecutive
cards of the same rank are allowed in the same tableau pile.  This is
called a proil, and the fourth card of the same rank cannot be moved to
a proil.  Empty piles cannot be filled.  The reserve card can be moved
to an appropriate tableau pile at any time, but once the reserve is
empty, only a king can be moved to it.
<p>
The foundations are built up by suit.  The game is won if
all cards are moved to the foundations.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
The name "Proil" is a distortion of "Pair Royal", which describes
a three-of-a-kind in Cribbage.
