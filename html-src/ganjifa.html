<h1>General Ganjifa Card Rules</h1>
Ganjifa are playing cards from India and other nations in the
region. Usually round, some rectangular decks have been produced.
The most significant difference between Ganjifa and other types of
cards is that Ganjifa cards have traditionally been individually
hand painted. There are any where from eight to twelve or more
suits per deck, each suit having usually twelve ranks. The two most
common Ganjifa decks are the Mughal which has eight suits and the
Dashavatara which has ten. The suits have pip cards numbered from
Ace through ten and two court cards, the Wazir and the Mir. Ganjifa
solitaire games play the same as games that use the standard deck
but the larger number of different cards in a deck (96 or 120) adds
an element of complexity. The fact that each suit has it's own
color makes things quite interesting in games that use "Alternate
Color" row stacks.
