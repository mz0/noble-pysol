<h1>General Flower Card Rules</h1>
<p>There are some characteristics common to all the games played
with Hanafuda cards. They are all played with one or more of the
Asian flower card decks. This deck is common in a number of Pacific
regions including Hawaii. There are twelve suits of four cards
each. The suits are associated with the twelve months of the year.
For a good explanation of what the suits are, try <a href=
"http://hanafubuki.org/">Graham Leonard's Hanafuda and Kabufuda
site</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the flower card solitaire games are played like western
deck games with minor changes. See the <a href=
"general_rules.html">General Rules</a> for basic instructions on
how to play solitaire. The object in most cases is to move all the
cards from the tableau to the foundations. Probably the most
difficult part of learning to play with hanafuda cards is learning
which cards belong in which suits and what their ranking is. The
ranking of the suits is sometimes as important as the ranking of
the cards in the suit. Try keeping this hanafuda help image
displayed where you can refer to it as you play. <img alt="" src=
