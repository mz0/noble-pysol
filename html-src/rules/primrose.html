<h1>Primrose</h1>
<p>
Numerica type. 2 decks. 8 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Eight cards are dealt to eight reserves, and the remaining cards are dealt to
eight tableau piles.  The foundations build up by rank ignoring suit. The base
rank for each foundation is one higher than the reserve above it.
<p>
Each foundation must be completed by using the card from the reserve above it.
<p>
There is no building on the tableau piles - cards can only be moved to the
foundations, and spaces are not filled.
<p>
When no more moves are possible, you can redeal by taking the first tableau
pile and dealing the cards from it evenly to the tableau piles.  For the next
redeal, you do the same with the second pile, and so on until you go through
all eight piles.
