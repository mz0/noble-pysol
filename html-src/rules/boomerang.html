<h1>Boomerang</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 stripped decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>

<p>
Boomerang is only played with the cards from seven through
king of each suit, plus the four aces, from two decks.  A
card is dealt to each of twelve tableau piles.  Cards in the
tableau can be built either up or down in suit.  However,
each pile must follow only one of these rules.
<p>
Foundation piles are to be built in suit, first up from seven
to king, then an ace is played on the king, and it is built
back down from king to seven, with the other ace placed on top
to finish the pile.  So they are ultimately built in the order
7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-A.
<p>
Cards can be dealt from the talon one at a time, and moved to
an appropriate tableau or foundation pile.  There is no redeal.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Boomerang was invented by Albert Morehead and Geoffrey
Mott-Smith.
