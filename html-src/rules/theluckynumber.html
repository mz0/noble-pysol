<h1>The Lucky Number</h1>
<p>
Pairing game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the single foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Twelve piles of four cards each are dealt to the tableau.  Pairs of cards
that total eleven can be moved to the foundation.  When there are no moves
left, cards can be dealt from the talon one at a time and paired off with
the tableau cards.  When a tableau pile is empty, it is filled from the
top card of the waste, or talon if the waste is empty.
<p>
Picture cards are removed in a set of Jack, Queen, King.  A
single picture card of each type can be moved to the three reserves,
but they must all be discarded at the same time - no further cards
can be dealt from the talon or filled from the waste until a set of
three has been removed.
<p>
No redeal is allowed.  The game is won if all cards have been discarded.
