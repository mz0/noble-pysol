<h1>Les Quatre Coins</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to two columns of six cards each.  The top and bottom cards
are the corner cards, and are placed slightly separate from the rest of the
tableau.  There are two columns of foundations between the middle four cards
of each column.
<p>
First, an ace and king of each suit must be moved to the foundations, with the
aces on the left and kings on the right, and cards of the same suit next to each
other.  Once an ace and king of each suit is in the foundation, the piles can be
built further, with the ace piles built up by same suit to king and the king
piles built down by same suit to ace.  A card can only be moved to the foundation
pile next to it, though corner cards can be moved to any foundation.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal one card from the talon to each of
the tableau piles.  Once the talon is empty, you can build tableau piles up
or down regardless of suit, and can move any card to the foundation, regardless
of its position.  Empty tableau piles cannot be filled.  At this point, once
there are no moves left, you can combine the tableau piles to form a new talon
and redeal.  You are allowed two redeals.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
