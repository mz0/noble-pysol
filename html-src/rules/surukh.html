<h1>Surukh</h1>
Dashavatara Ganjifa type. One deck. No redeal.
<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the foundations.
<h3>Quick description</h3>
The cards build down by rank in alternating force on the tableau,
no more than twelve to a row. Only the Rajas may be played on an
empty row.
<h3>Rules</h3>
All cards are dealt to the sixteen rows when the games begins.
Cards on the tableau build down in rank in alternating force. See
the general <a href="../ganjifa.html">Ganjifa</a> rules for more
information. The easy way to remember the force of a suit is that
the foundations to the left are one force and the foundations to
the right are the other. The foundations build up by suit. Any card
or sequence may be played on an empty row.

Try for an empty row.
