<h1>Glenwood</h1>
<p>Canfield type. 1 deck. One redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Move all cards to the foundations.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>The first item of play is to select an available card for the
first Foundation. Once selected, all other Foundations must also
start with this value.</p>
<p>Foundations are built up by suit, wrapping from King to Ace
where necessary. Once a card is placed on a Foundation pile, it is
out of play.</p>
<p>Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color. Whole
piles of cards can be moved on to another Tableau pile. Empty slots
in the Tableau can be filled by any available card in the Reserves
or, if all the Reserves are empty, from the Waste.</p>
<p>Cards are flipped singly from Stock to Waste. There is one
redeal.</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>Be careful when selecting your first Foundation pile. Try to get
the cards out of the Reserves as early as possible. Sometimes
keeping cards in play is more important than moving them to the
Foundation.</p>
