<h1>Amazons</h1>
<p>
Numerica type. 1 stripped deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Amazons is played with only the Aces and Sevens through
queens of each suit.  The remaining cards are removed.
<p>
A card is dealt to each of four tableau piles.  No building
on the tableau is allowed - cards can only be moved from the
tableau to foundations.  The foundations are built up by rank,
regardless of suit, with the sevens played on the aces.  With
the exception of the aces and queens, a card can only be moved
to the foundation from the tableau pile directly below it.
<p>
Once the talon is empty, you can pick up the tableau piles and
combine them to form a new talon.  You can do this as many
times as necessary.
<p>
Once a foundation is filled, cards are no longer dealt to the
tableau pile directly below it.  The game is won if all the
cards are moved to the foundations.
