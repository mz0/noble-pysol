<h1>King Only Baker's Game</h1>
<p>FreeCell type. 1 deck. No redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Move all cards to the foundations.</p>
<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>Just like <a href="bakersgame.html">Baker's Game</a>, but only
Kings on empty spaces.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>All cards are dealt at the start of the game. To compensate for
this there are 4 free cells which can hold any - and just one -
card.</p>
<p>Piles build down by suit, and you can only move Kings to empty
slots.</p>
<p>The number of cards you can move as a sequence is restricted by
the number of free cells - the number of free cells required is the
same as if you would make an equivalent sequence of moves with
single cards.</p>
