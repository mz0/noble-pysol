<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the single foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A single card is dealt to a foundation, and nine cards are
dealt to tableau piles in a circle around the foundation.
The foundation is built up by rank, regardless of suit, turning
the corner from king to ace as necessary.

Cards can be dealt from the talon one at a time, and moved
to the foundation or tableau piles.  Any card can be moved to
the tableau, regardless of rank, but once a card is moved to
the tableau, it can only be moved to the foundation.

The game is won if all the cards can be moved to the foundation
in a single sequence.
