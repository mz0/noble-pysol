<h1>Blue Moon</h1>
<p>Montana type. 1 deck. 2 redeals.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Group all the cards in sets of 13 cards in ascending sequence by
suit from Ace to King.</p>
<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>Just like <a href="montana.html">Montana</a>, but the Aces are
moved to the left.<br />
Gameplay is completely equivalent.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>This 52-card solitaire starts with the entire deck shuffled and
dealt out in four rows. The aces are then moved to the left end of
the layout, making 4 initial free spaces. You may move to a space
only the card that matches the left neighbor in suit, and is one
greater in rank. Kings are high, so no cards may be placed to their
right (they create dead spaces).</p>
<p>When no moves can be made, cards still out of sequence are
reshuffled and dealt face up after the ends of the partial
sequences, leaving a card space after each sequence, so that each
row looks like a partial sequence followed by a space, followed by
enough cards to make a row of 14.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p><i>Autodrop</i> is disabled for this game.</p>
