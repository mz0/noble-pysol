Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The aces are dealt to the foundations, and ten cards are dealt to
each of four tableau piles.  No building is allowed on these piles,
but two additional tableau piles are available (with no cards dealt
to them at the start), which are built down by alternate color from
king to ace, with only the top card visible.
<p>
The top card of each tableau pile can be moved to one of the extra
tableau piles or foundations.  The foundations are built up by
alternate color from ace to king.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal cards from the talon one
at a time, and can move them to appropriate tableau or foundation
piles.  You can go through the talon as many times as necessary.
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
