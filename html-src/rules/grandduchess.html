<h1>Grand Duchess</h1>
<p>
Numerica type. 2 decks. 3 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of four tableau piles, and one card
is dealt face-down to two reserve piles, one on each side of the
tableau.  Building on the tableau is not allowed, and cards in
the tableau can only be moved to foundations.
<p>
One set of foundations for each suit is built up by suit from ace
to king, and one set is built down by suit from king to ace.
<p>
When there are no moves left, deal a card to each tableau and
reserve pile, from left to right.  Cards dealt to the reserves
are dealt face-down, but when the stock is empty, both full reserves
are flipped face-up.  After the stock is empty, you can combine all
six piles to form a new stock, and redeal.  You can do this a max of
three times.  After the third redeal, the reserves are no longer
used, and cards are only dealt to tableau piles.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
