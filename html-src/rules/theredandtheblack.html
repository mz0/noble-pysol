<h1>The Red and the Black</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
All the aces are dealt to the foundations.  A card is dealt
to each of four tableau piles and four free cells.  The tableau
piles are built down by alternate color, arranged so only the top
card is visible.  Cards from the free cells can only be moved to
the tableau, and cards can only be moved to the free cells from
the waste pile.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal cards from the talon
one at a time and can move them to the tableau, foundations, or
an empty free cell.  No redeals are allowed.  The foundations
are built up by alternate color from ace to king.  The game is
won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
