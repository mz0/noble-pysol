<h1>Flower Arrangement</h1>
<p>Two-Deck game type. Two Hanafuda decks. No redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Arrange the Flower Cards in suit order.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>The layout consists of three rows of playing piles and a row for
newly dealt cards.</p>
<p>The cards must be arranged from forth rank to first in the top
three rows as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first row will only accept the first four suits, Pine,
Plum, Cherry and Wisteria</li>
<li>the second row will accept the second four, Iris, Peony, Bush
Clover and Eularia</li>
<li>and the third row will accept the last four, Chrysanthemum,
Maple, Willow and Paulownia.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you clear a space at the bottom it will be automatically
filled with a card from the talon. But if the talon is gone and you
clear a space at the bottom, then you can fill it with any card.
When no further moves are possible, click on the talon for a fresh
row of cards at the bottom.</p>
<p>You win when all of the suits are arranged in order.</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>Because of the many piles involved the Picture Gallery requires
some concentration, but it is not too hard to win.</p>
