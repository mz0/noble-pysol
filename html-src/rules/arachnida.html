Spider type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Group all the cards in sets of 13 cards in descending sequence
by suit from King to Ace and move such sets to the foundation.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to ten tableau piles - four with six cards and six
with five.  Only the top card of each pile is face-up.  Tableau piles
are built down by rank or by same rank.  Only single cards or sequences
of cards that are the same rank or built down by suit can be moved
between tableau piles.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal one card from the talon to
each tableau pile.
<p>
When a same suit sequence is created that goes all the way from king to
ace, it is immediately moved to a foundation pile.  The game is won if
all cards are moved to this foundation pile.
