<h1>Dnieper</h1>
<p>
Spider type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Group all the cards in sets of 13 cards in descending sequence
by suit from King to Ace and move such sets to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="kiev.html">Kiev</a>, but sequences in the tableau
can turn the corner, so kings can be played on aces.
