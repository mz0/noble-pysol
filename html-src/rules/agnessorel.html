<h1>Agnes Sorel</h1>
<p>Gypsy type. 1 deck. No redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Move all cards to the foundations.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>Cards in the Tableau are built down by same color. Groups of
cards in sequence and same color can be moved as a unit.</p>
<p>Each deal flips one card from the Stock to each pile of the
Tableau. There are no redeals.</p>
<p>Foundations are built up in suit in sequence, wrapping from King
to Ace when necessary. Cards in Foundations are still in play.
Double clicking on a card in the Tableau will move it to the
appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>Try to build down in suit whenever possible. Try to score as
many points as you can as this game is very hard to win.</p>
