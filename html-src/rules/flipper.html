<h1>Flipper</h1>
<p>
FreeCell type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="penguin.html">Penguin</a>,
but no cards are dealt to the foundations at the
start of the game (like <a href="tuxedo.html">Tuxedo</a>).
<p>
If any reserves are used, the top card of the tableau
pile next to it is flipped face-down and that pile can't
be used until that reserve is emptied.
