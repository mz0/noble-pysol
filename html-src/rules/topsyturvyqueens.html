<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>

Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Build the tableau stacks down by the same suit, turning
the corner as needed (aces can be played on kings and vice versa).
Any card can be placed in an empty tableau stack.
<p>
Build the foundation stacks up by suit, starting with a king,
then the ace, and the remaining cards in sequence up to the
queen.  There are seven cards above the first seven foundations -
these cards are locked, and may be flipped face-up and used only
once the foundation below them has been filled.  Once placed in a
foundation, cards cannot be moved.

When you get stuck, you can deal cards one at a time from the stock.
You can go through the stock a total of three times.
<p>
The game is won when all eight foundations are filled.
