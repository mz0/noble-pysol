<h1>Diamond Mine</h1>
<p>One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Remove all diamonds to the foundation and have all the other
cards in suit and sequence with Aces being low in the Tableau.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>Cards (other than diamonds) can be built down in sequence
regardless of suit. Builds of cards can be moved as a unit. Empty
slots can be filled by any card (except for diamonds) or build of
cards.</p>
<p>Diamonds cannot be moved except to be place on to the
Foundation. The diamond Foundation must be built up in sequence but
can start from any number you want.</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>Mining for diamonds is hard work. Keep in mind that not all
diamonds are worth the same. Don't forget to clean up after
yourself and put the other suits in order.</p>
