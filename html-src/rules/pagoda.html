<h1>Pagoda</h1>
<p>Hanafuda type. 2 decks. No redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Move all cards to the foundations.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>When the hand is dealt, the twenty reserve stacks of the pagoda
are filled with cards. The twelve foundation stacks on the right
are labeled with the names of the twelve suits. Cards are played on
the foundations first upwards from the fourth rank to the first,
then downwards from first to fourth. When the first card is played
on a foundation, the label changes from the suit name to "Rising".
When the fifth card is played, the label changes to "Setting". When
the last card is played, the label reverts to the suit name. Cards
can be played on the foundations from the reserve stacks or from
the waste stack. An empty foundation will only accept the fourth
rank card of the correct suit. Cards are dealt from the talon four
at a time, and there is only one round.</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>Hint: it's important to keep one or more reserve stacks open
during the early stages of the game.</p>
