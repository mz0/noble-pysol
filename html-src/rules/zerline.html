Beleaguered Castle type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>

Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to eight tableau piles of five cards each.
Tableau piles are built down by rank, regardless of suit.
Only single cards can be moved between tableau piles, and
only queens can fill empty piles.
<p>
There is a single reserve pile, that can hold a max of four
cards.  Only cards from the tableau can be moved to the
reserve, and the top card of the reserve can be moved back to
the tableau or foundations.  When there are no moves left,
you can deal cards from the talon one at a time, and move them
to tableau piles or foundations.  No redeal is allowed.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit, starting with kings.
The ace is then played on the king and the foundations are
built up to queen.  The game is won if all cards are moved
to the foundations.
