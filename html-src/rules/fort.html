<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="braid.html">Braid</a>,
but an ace and king of each suit are dealt to
the foundations at the start of the game.  The
foundations with the aces are built up by same suit,
while the ones with the kings are built down.  Also,
there is an extra card in the braid.
