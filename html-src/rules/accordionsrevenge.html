<h1>Accordion's Revenge</h1>
<p>
One deck type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Remove all the cards except the one card declared at the start.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="accordion.html">Accordion</a>,
but at the start of the game, a single card is randomly declared.
This card must be the last remaining card in order to win the game.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Accordion's Revenge is unwinnable if the first or second card is
declared.  As such, PySol will reselect the declared card if it
is chosen.
<p>
The concept of Accordion's Revenge was invented by Mark Masten.
