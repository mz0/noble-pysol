<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="gypsy.html">Gypsy</a>,
but with seven tableau piles, with four cards in the
middle one, and one fewer in each pile to the left and
right (all cards dealt face-up).  Also, cards cannot be
dealt from the talon if there are any empty piles.

Additionally, when there are only four cards left in the
talon, they can be dealt straight to four reserve piles,
and freely moved to the tableau or foundations when
possible.
