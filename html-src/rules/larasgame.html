<h1>Lara's Game</h1>
<p>Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Move all cards to the foundations.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>Cards are dealt to 14 piles. The piles are organized Ace through
five, six through ten, and then the three face cards, followed by
the Talon. [Yes, cards are dealt to the talon!] The rules for this
deal are as follows:</p>
<p>Cards are dealt to the first thirteen piles in order, until the
104 cards have been used up. If the dealt card matches the place of
the pile it is placed on, one card is dealt to the talon. If the
card is a face card, one card is dealt to the talon. If the card is
an Ace, two cards are dealt to the talon. Each time the deal
reaches the King pile, two cards are dealt to the talon and the
deal starts over at the Ace pile.</p>
<p>The four top foundations build up from Ace, while the left four
Foundations build down from King. Only the top card of any stack is
playable, and the rest of the cards are hidden.</p>
<p>The piles at the bottom of the screen represent the player's
hand. Whenever a card is dealt from the talon, the player picks up
the corresponding pile, places the dealt card at the bottom of the
hand plays any cards that can be played, and replaces the hand to
the pile that was picked up.</p>
<p>There is no redeal.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>This game was taught to me by a wonderful woman. Neither she nor
I knows where the game originated (it was taught to her by her
older sister). This game is dedicated to her. Note: it was taught
to her by her *other* older sister. So it really shouldn't be
called Lara's game. But that's what I'm used to calling it, so thus
it remains.</p>
