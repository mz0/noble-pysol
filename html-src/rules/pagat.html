<h1>Pagat</h1>
<p>Tarock type. 1 deck. No redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Move all cards to the foundations.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>This is a Freecell type of game. Cards on the tableau build down
in rank by suit. Cards build up in rank on the foundations. A stack
can be moved if the cards are in decending rank order regardless of
the suit. Any card or stack can be played on an empty row.</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>The foundations are less important early in the game than
building movable stacks. Use the reserve stacks carefully.</p>
