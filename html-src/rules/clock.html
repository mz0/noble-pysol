<h1>Clock</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the correct pile in the tableau, before the fourth
king is revealed.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>The tableau is dealt in a circle of twelve piles, similar to the
twelve numbers on a clock, with a thirteenth pile placed in the middle.
Each pile represents cards of the number in that position on a clock,
with Jacks in the 11 o'clock pile and queens in the 12 o'clock pile.
Kings go in the middle.
<p>
Take one card from the middle pile, and place that card face-up on the
bottom of the pile for that rank.  Then, take a card from that pile,
move it in its rightful place, and so on.
<p>
As the first card was taken from the center pile, if the four kings are
found before the other eleven piles are completed, there will be no
more cards to play and the game is lost.
