<h1>Interlock</h1>
<p>
Klondike type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The tableau piles are built in a pyramid-esque layout, with eleven cards
in the top layer, ten cards in the middle, and nine on the bottom.
Each card forms a tableau pile which can be built down by alternate
color.  The three bottom layer cards can be filled with a king when
empty, but the remaining layers cannot be filled.
<p>
Though all cards are dealt face-up, cards in the lower layers cannot
be moved until the cards on top of them are moved.  However, if the
only card or sequence overlapping a card can legally be played on it,
that sequence can be moved down in a dropdown move.
<p>
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the stock one at a time, and can be moved to
foundations or exposed tableau piles.  You can go through the deck
as many times as needed.
<p>
The game is won when all cards are moved to the foundations.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Interlock is an original game that's a more straightforward variant
of other interlocking tableau games, such as
