<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Fill all of the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
There are two rows of foundations, one for odd cards and one for even cards.
As such, the odd foundations (the top row) are built 3-5-7-9-J, and the even
foundations (the bottom row) are built 2-4-6-8-10-Q. These piles are built up
by suit. The kings are not used in this game.
<p>
Aces are placed in a separate castoff pile.  This pile is built up by
alternating colors.
<p>
Eight stacks of four cards are dealt. The top card of each of these piles may be
played to an appropriate foundation. You may turn over cards in the talon to the
waste pile one at a time, and the top card of the waste pile may also be played to
an appropriate foundation.
<p>
If one of the eight stacks is empty, deal four cards from the top of the waste pile
to form a new stack to replace it. If there are no cards in the waste pile, deal
from the talon instead.
<p>
Once the talon is empty, you may move cards between the stacks, building down by suit,
or playing any card on empty stacks once the waste pile is empty. The game is won
when all of the foundations are filled.
