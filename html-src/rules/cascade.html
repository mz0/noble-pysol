<p>
Forty Thieves type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to seven piles of five cards each.  The tableau piles
are built down by alternate color, and only single cards can be moved
between piles.  There are also two free cells that any single card can
be moved to/from freely.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal cards one at a time from the
talon, and move them to an appropriate tableau/free cell/foundation pile.
No redeal is allowed, so you can only go through the talon once.
<p>
The foundations are built up by alternate color from ace to king.  The
game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
