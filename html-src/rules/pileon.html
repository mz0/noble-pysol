<h1>PileOn</h1>
<p>One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Rearrange the cards so that each pile contains four cards with
the same rank.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>Rearrange the cards so that each pile contains four cards with
the same rank. This should leave two piles empty.</p>
<p>Cards can be moved on top of any other card or cards of the same
rank. Groups of cards can be moved if they are of the same
rank.</p>
<p>A pile cannot have more than four cards, and an empty slot can
be filled with any card or group of cards with the same rank.</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>Keep one of the piles clear as much as possible. Don't allow a
pile of three cards to build up on top of a single card, especially
if the final card from the set is not a bottom card in another
pile.</p>
