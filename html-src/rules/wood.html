Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="terrace.html">Terrace</a>, but a card is dealt to
all nine tableau piles at the start.  A single card is dealt to
one of the foundations to determine the starting rank.  Also,
empty cards in the tableau are not automatically filled
from the waste pile or stock.  Instead, any other card from the
tableau or waste can be used to fill empty piles.
