<h1>Four Seasons</h1>
Hanafuda type. 1 deck. No redeal.
<h3>Object</h3>
Arrange all the cards on the rows.
<h3>Rules</h3>
This is a <a href="fan.html">Fan</a> type game adapted to the
Hanafuda cards. The tableau consists of twelve rows. Any stack may
be moved, but only a first rank card will play on an empty row. The
trash cards are not interchangeable, and no more than eight cards
can be played on a row. The game is won when all twelve suits are
arranged in order in their respective places on the tableau.
<h3>Strategy</h3>
Not all Four Seasons hands are solvable. Try to get an open row.
