<h1>Magic Montana</h1>
<p>
Hex A Deck type. 1 deck. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Group all the cards in sets of 17 cards in ascending sequence
by suit from 1 to 16, with a wizard at the end of each row.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="montana.html">Montana</a>, but with a Hex A Deck.
The initial column is dealt empty, and the sequences are built up
from 1 to 16.  Wizards are wild, and can be freely moved anywhere,
except directly after another wizard or an empty space.  Ultimately,
the wizards must be in the column at the far right, adjacent to the
10s, at the end of the game.

<h3>Notes</h3>
