<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Twelve cards are dealt to twelve tableau piles.  Tableau piles are
built down by rank, regardless of suit, wrapping from ace to king
as necessary.  Any valid card or sequence of cards can be moved
between piles, and any sequence can be moved to empty piles.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the talon to the waste, two at a time.  The
topmost card from the waste can be moved to a foundation or tableau
pile.  No further cards can be dealt from the talon until both of
the previous cards have been played.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit, from ace to king, and then
wrapping around for a second sequence.  The game is won if all cards
are moved to the foundations.
