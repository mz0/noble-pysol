<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt to eight piles of eight cards each, with only
the top cards face-up.  Tableau piles are built down by rank,
regardless of suit, and any valid sequence of cards can be moved
to an appropriate tableau pile.
<p>
If all of the face-up cards on a tableau pile are removed, the
face-down cards are dealt to the other tableau piles, one on
each (none to the pile that was just exposed).  Then, if there
are cards left in the talon, eight more cards are dealt to that
empty pile in the same manner as before.  If there are no cards
left in the talon, that tableau pile remains empty, and any
card or sequence can be moved to it.
<p>
The foundations are built up by suit from ace to king.  The game
is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
