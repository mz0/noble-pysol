<h3>Object</h3>

Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Eight cards are dealt to tableau piles, and two sets of eleven
cards are dealt to two reserve piles - one additional reserve
card is placed on top of both piles, overlapping them.  This card
must be moved before any card from the other reserve piles is
moved.  Only the top card from the reserves can be moved.
<p>
Tableau piles are built down by the same suit.  Only one card at
a time can be moved between tableau piles, or a card from the
reserve can be moved to a tableau pile.  However, you cannot
build on the reserves.
<p>
Aces can be moved to the foundations, which are then built up
by suit.
<p>
You can deal cards from the talon one at a time, and move these
cards to the tableau or foundation.  No redeal is allowed.
