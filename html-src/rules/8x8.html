<h1>8 x 8</h1>
<p>Klondike type. 2 decks. Unlimited redeals.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Move all cards to the foundations.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>As the name implies, the eight playing piles in the tableau all
start with eight cards face-up.</p>
<p>Piles build down by alternate color, and an empty space can be
filled with any card or sequence.</p>
<p>When you click on the talon, one card is turned over onto the
waste pile. There is no limit to the number of times you go through
the talon.</p>
<p>You are also permitted to move cards back out of the
foundation.</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>Try to go for an empty space.</p>
