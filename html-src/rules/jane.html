<h1>Jane</h1>
<p>Raglan type. 1 deck. No redeals.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Move all cards to the foundations.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color. Groups
of cards can be moved. An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled
with a card whose rank is one lower than the base card or with a
group of cards starting with a card with this rank.</p>
<p>Cards are dealt from the Stock to the Reserve. Each deal places
one card on each pile of the Reserve.</p>
<p>The top card of each Reserve pile is always available for play
on to either the Tableau or the Foundation. There is no building on
the Reserve piles.</p>
<p>Foundations are built up in suit from the base card. New
Foundations are started when a card of the same rank as the first
card placed during the dealing period are placed on empty
Foundation piles. Aces are placed on Kings, and twos on Aces. Cards
in Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card will
move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is
possible.</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>The deeper something is, the harder it is to get to. Try and
move cards out of the Reserve whenever possible.</p>
