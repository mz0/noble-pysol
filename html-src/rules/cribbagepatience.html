<h1>Cribbage Patience</h1>
<p>
Cribbage type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Deal five cribbage hands to get a total score of 61 points or more.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Six cards are dealt face-up, and two cards are dealt face-down to the crib.
Move two cards from the six face-up cards to the crib, then flip the
face-down cards.  Then, one card is dealt face-up to be the starter.
<p>
Points are awarded for the 2 Cribbage hands: the remaining four cards, plus
the four cards in the crib.
<p>
After each hand, repeat the process four more times to deal a total of five
hands.  You win if after all five hands, your score reaches 61 points.
<h3>Cribbage Scoring</h3>
<p>
Cribbage hands are scored as follows - each hand is worth the total value
of all of the following:
<ul>
<li>15 - 2 points are added to each hand for every combination of cards that
adds up to 15.
<li>Pair - 2 points are added for each set of two cards of the same rank.
<li>Pair Royal - For sets of the same rank of more than two cards, they
are scored by the number of individual pairs they contain.
<li>Run - Each combination of three or more cards of consecutive ranks
scores 1 point per card.  Only the largest possible run is considered.
<li>Flush - Four cards of the same suit are worth 4 points.  The starter
is not considered when scoring flushes, but if it does match the suit of a
flush, that is an extra point.
<li>His Nobs - A jack of the same suit as the starter adds 1 point to
the hand.
<li>His Heels - If the starter is a Jack, 2 points are added to the
entire game.
</ul>
