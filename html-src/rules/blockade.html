Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Twelve cards are dealt to twelve tableau piles.  Tableau piles
can be built down by same suit, and any valid card or sequence of
cards can be moved between piles.  Empty tableau piles are immediately
filled with a card from the talon - if the talon is empty, any card or
sequence can be moved to an empty pile.
<p>
If you are stuck, you can deal one card from the talon to the top of each
tableau pile.
<p>
Foundations are built up from ace to king by same suit.  The game is
won when all cards are moved to the foundations.
