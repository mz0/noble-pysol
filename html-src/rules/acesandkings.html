<h1>Aces and Kings</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The four leftmost foundations are built up from ace to king,
while the four foundations on the right are built down from
king to ace.
<p>
There are two thirteen card reserves, along with four tableau piles.
The topmost card of the reserve may be moved to any appropriate
foundation, as may any of the tableau cards.  No building is allowed
on the tableau, and if a tableau card is moved, it is replaced from
the top of the talon.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the talon one at a time.  No redeal is allowed.
When the talon is empty, any card can be moved to an empty tableau
pile.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Note that you are allowed to move cards from one foundation to
another.  In fact, it's pretty much necessary to win.
