Golf type. 1 deck. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundation stack.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Deal cards one at a time from the stock. Cards from the waste
pile can be moved to the foundation, building up or down by rank.
You are allowed to redeal twice, meaning you can go through the
deck a total of three times.
<p>
The sequence wraps around, so aces can be played on kings, and
vice versa.
<p>
The game is won when all of the cards have been moved to the
foundation.
