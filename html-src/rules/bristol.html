Fan game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Three cards are dealt to eight tableau piles.  These tableau piles
are built down by rank regardless of suit.  Empty piles cannot be filled
- therefore all Kings are placed at the bottom of a pile during the
initial dealing.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the talon three at a time, one to each of three waste
piles.  These cards can be moved to the tableau or foundations.  No redeal
is allowed.
<p>
The foundations are built up by rank, regardless of suit.  The game is won
if all cards are moved to the foundations.
