<h1>Grounds for a Divorce</h1>
<p>Spider type. 2 decks. No redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Group all the cards in sets of 13 cards in descending sequence
by same suit and move such sets to the foundations. The sequence
may wrap around.</p>
<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>Like <a href="spider.html">Spider</a>, but sequences wrap around
from Ace to King, and no card will be dealt to an empty space.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>50 cards are dealt in 10 piles. Cards are built down, regardless
of suit. However, sequences that are all of the same suit are
preferred because these are available for further movement. A space
can be filled by any card or legal group of cards.</p>
<p>Sequences wrap around, i.e. Kings may be placed on Aces.</p>
<p>The object is to group the cards in descending sets of 13 cards
of the same suit. These sequences may wrap around as well. Such
groups can then be moved to the foundations.</p>
<p>When no more moves are possible, click on the talon. One card
will be added to each <i>non empty</i> space.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>This is my favorite <a href="spider.html">Spider</a> variant.
Even more decisions, and with a fair chance of coming out. The
original German name is <i>Scheidungsgrund</i>.</p>
