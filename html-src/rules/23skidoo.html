<h1>23 Skidoo</h1>
<p>
One deck type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Compress the entire deck into two piles.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="accordion.html">Accordion</a>,
but you only move cards if they are separated by
one or two cards, not if they are right next to
each other.
<p>
Because of this, the game is won when there are
only two piles left (it is impossible to get only
one pile under these rules).
