<h1>FreeCell</h1>
<p>FreeCell type. 1 deck. No redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Move all cards to the foundations.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>FreeCell is played with one deck. All cards are dealt at the
start of the game. To compensate for this there are 4 free cells
which can hold any - and just one - card.</p>
<p>Piles build down by alternate color, and an empty space can be
filled with any card or sequence.</p>
<p>The number of cards you can move as a sequence is restricted by
the number of free cells - the number of free cells required is the
same as if you would make an equivalent sequence of moves with
single cards. (As a shortcut, the computer also considers the
number of free piles so that you can move even more cards as one
single sequence.)</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Game numbers in the range 1 to 32000 are compatible to the ones
