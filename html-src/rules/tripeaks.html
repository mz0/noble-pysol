<h1>Tri Peaks</h1>
<p>Golf type. 1 deck. No redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Move all cards to the waste stack.</p>
<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>Much like <a href="relaxedgolf.html">Relaxed Golf</a>, only with
a <a href="pyramid.html">Pyramid</a> related layout.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>Build singly on the waste stack up or down regardless of
suit.</p>
<p>Only the top card is available for play. When no more moves are
possible, click on the talon to deal a new card.</p>
<p>Sequences wrap around, i.e. Twos and Kings may be placed on Aces
and Queens and Aces may be placed on Kings.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>There is a simple scoring system here - you debit $120 for each
game ($5 for each of the 24 cards in the talon) and for every card
you bear off, you get $1, $2, $3,... credit, depending on the
length of your current streak.<br />
Each cleared peak gains $15 bonus, and there's an additional $30 if
you manage to clear all three peaks.<br />
Your balance is reset whenever you select a different game. Loaded
games and manually entered game numbers don't count.</p>
<p><i>Autodrop</i> is disabled for this game.</p>
