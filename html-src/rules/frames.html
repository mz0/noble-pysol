<h1>Frames</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
A card is dealt to each of three rows of four cards each.  This
forms the picture.  Fourteen cards are then dealt around the
picture, four cards above and below, and three cards to the
left and right.  This forms the frame.  The foundations are in
the corners.
<p>
Piles in the frame are built up or down by same suit, but you
cannot switch direction mid-sequence.  Cards from the frame
can be moved to another pile.  Cards from the picture can be moved
to a frame pile, but only if it's in the same row or column.  The
piles in the picture are then immediately filled from the waste,
or the talon if the waste is empty.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit from ace to king, followed
by another King, then back down to Ace, giving 26 cards per pile
when the game is won.  Only cards in the frame can be moved to the
foundations.
<p>
Though you are allowed to deal cards from the talon one at a time,
these cards cannot be manually moved to the frame, picture, or
foundation, and simply determines which card is dealt next when
an empty spot is formed in the picture.  No redeal is allowed.
<p>
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.
