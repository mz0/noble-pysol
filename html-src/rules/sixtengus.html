<h1>Six Tengus</h1>
Hanafuda type. 1 deck. No redeal.
<h3>Object</h3>

Garden</a> except there are six row stacks that will each hold up
to nine cards. Two cards may be moved at a time if they are in rank
order.

The Tengu is a mythical Japanese character of exceptional fighting
skill. You will need great skill (and more than a little luck)
