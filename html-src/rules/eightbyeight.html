<h1>Eight by Eight</h1>
<p>
Klondike type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="8x8.html">8 x 8</a>, but tableau piles are built
regardless of suit, only single cards can be moved to empty
tableau piles, and there are two redeals allowed - during the
first deal, cards are dealt in threes, and one fewer card is
dealt from the talon at a time after each redeal.
