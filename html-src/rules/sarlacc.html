<h1>Sarlacc</h1>
<p>
FreeCell type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The tableau piles are built in a pyramid-esque layout, with all cards dealt
to alternating rows of ten and eleven cards.  Each card forms a tableau pile
which can be built down by alternate color.  Only single cards can be moved,
though sequences can be moved based on the number of six open free cells.
The bottom layer cards can be filled with a king when empty, but the remaining
layers cannot be filled.
<p>
Though all cards are dealt face-up, cards in the lower layers cannot
be moved until the cards on top of them are moved.  However, if the
only card or sequence overlapping a card can legally be played on it,
that sequence can be moved down in a dropdown move.
<p>
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.  The game is won when
all cards are moved to the foundations.
