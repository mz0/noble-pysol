<h1>Cherry Bomb</h1>
Hanafuda type. 2 decks. No redeal.
<h3>Object</h3>
Move all cards to the foundations.
<h3>Quick description</h3>
This is a double deck version of <a href="firecracker.html">Fire
Cracker</a>. The rows build down in rank in the same suit. The
foundations build with cards of the same rank in suit order.
<h3>Rules</h3>
The rows build from first rank to fourth rank by suit. The
foundations build in ascending suit order from Pine to Phoenix by
rank. The third and fourth rank (trash) cards are interchangeable
on the tableau. Cards may not be played from the foundations. Any
card or correctly ordered pile may be played on an empty row.
<h3>Strategy</h3>
Build sequences on the tableau. Since the trash cards are
interchangeable it's possible to build a valid sequence that has
more than four cards in a two deck game.
