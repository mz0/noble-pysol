Pairing game type. 1 deck. No redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the single foundation.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="nestor.html">Nestor</a>,
but with a different layout (six stacks of six cards
and one of seven, and nine reserve cards).  Also, it
is possible for two cards of the same rank to be in
a single column, so extra care must be taken not to
trap the last remaining pair of a given rank in the
same column.
