<h1>Gypsy</h1>
<p>Gypsy type. 2 decks. No redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Move all cards to the foundations.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>The eight playing piles in the tableau all start with two cards
face-down and one showing. Piles build down by alternate color, and
an empty space can be filled with any card or sequence.</p>
<p>When no more moves are possible, click on the talon. One card
will be added to each of the playing piles.</p>
<p>You are also permitted to move cards back out of the
foundation.</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>Making heavy use of the Undo key is explicitly encouraged here -
you can win quite a number of games with a little bit of
thought.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>Gypsy is my all time favorite - it is probably the reason that I
started writing PySol at all...</p>
<p>I first met Gypsy almost fifteen years ago in the nice Atari ST
game <i>Patience</i> written by Volker Weidner. And as there seems
to be no official name of this variant I adopted the name Gypsy
from another game called <i>xpat2</i>.</p>
