<p>
Klondike type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>

Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="klondike.html">Klondike</a>,
but with nine piles, and the base rank of the foundations
is chosen by the first card you play to one.  Foundations
and tableau piles can turn the corner from king to ace as
necessary, and empty tableau piles can only be filled with
the rank one below the base foundation rank.
