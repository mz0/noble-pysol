<h1>Uintah</h1>
<p>
Golf type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Uintah is a variation of <a href="robert.html">Robert</a>
and <a href="wasatch.html">Wasatch</a> with four foundations.
<p>
At the start of the game, one random card of each suit is
placed on each of the foundations.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the stock in threes. Cards from the waste
pile can be moved to the foundation, building up or down by rank,
of the same colors.
<p>
The sequence wraps around, so aces can be played on kings, and
vice versa.
<p>
The game is won when all of the cards have been moved to the
foundations.
