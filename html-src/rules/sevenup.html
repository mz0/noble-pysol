<h1>Seven Up</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Remove all the cards.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt from the stock in a sequence.  Any sequence of two to four
cards with a total rank of 7, or any multiple of seven, may be removed.
Sevens can be removed singly.  Jacks are valued at 11, Queens at 12, and
Kings at 13.  The game is won if all cards are removed.
<p>
In PySol, a sequence is removed by selecting the first and last
card of the sequence.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
The average rank of the cards in a deck is 7, and the total of all cards of
each suit is 91, which is a multiple of 7.  Thus, the total of all cards in the
entire deck is 364, also a multiple of 7.
<p>
Under the original rules for this game, there was no limit to the number of
cards that could be removed at once.  But in this variant, the entire deck
can always be removed in the first move, so most modern variants limit the
number of cards that can be removed at once.
