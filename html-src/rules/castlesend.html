<h1>Castles End</h1>
<p>
Beleaguered Castle type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="bastion.html">Bastion</a>,
but before any other cards can be moved, any one card must be
moved to the foundations.  The foundations are then built up
by suit starting from that rank, wrapping from king to ace
as necessary.
<p>
Also, the tableau piles are built up or down by alternate
color.
