<h1>Neighbour</h1>
<p>Pairing game type. 1 deck. No redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Move all cards to the foundation.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>The object is to use up all the cards from the tableau, placing
them on the single foundation. You can only put a card on top of
another card when the numerical values of the two cards adds up to
13 and the two cards are touching horizontally, vertically or
diagonally (i.e. the cards have to be <i>Neighbours</i>).</p>
<p>You do not have to follow suit. Jack is worth 11 and Queen is
worth 12. All Kings go off alone.</p>
<p>Empty spaces are filled automatically by shifting cards up and
dealing from the talon to the bottom piles.</p>
<p>You win when the tableau piles are all gone.</p>
