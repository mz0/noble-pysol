<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Virginia Reel is a variation of <a href="royalparade.html">Royal Parade</a>,
intended to be an improvement to that game.
<p>
Gameplay is similar except cards are not dealt to replace empty piles in the
bottom row of the tableau.  Additionally, if any empty spaces are left in the
top three rows of the tableau, they must be filled immediately.  If they cannot,
no additional cards can be drawn from the stock until they are filled.
<p>
Also, a two, three, and four are dealt to the leftmost tableau piles at the
start of the game.
