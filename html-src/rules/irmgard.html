<h1>Irmgard</h1>
<p>Gypsy type. 2 decks. No redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Move all cards to the foundations.</p>
<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>Like <a href="gypsy.html">Gypsy</a>, but 9 piles and only Kings
on empty spaces.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>The playing piles build down by alternate color, and an empty
space can only be filled by a King or a sequence starting with a
King.</p>
<p>When no more moves are possible, click on the talon. One card
will be added to each of the playing piles, except for the last
turn where only 7 cards will be dealt.</p>
<p>You are also permitted to move cards back out of the
foundation.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>As with Gypsy you are allowed to make heavy use of the Undo
key.</p>
