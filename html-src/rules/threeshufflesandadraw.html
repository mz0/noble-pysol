<h1>Three Shuffles and a Draw</h1>
<p>Fan game type. 1 deck. 2 redeals.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Move all cards to the foundations.</p>
<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>Just like <a href="labellelucie.html">La Belle Lucie</a>, but
with an additional draw.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>The 18 piles build down by suit. Only one card can be moved at a
time. Empty piles are not filled.</p>
<p>When no more moves are possible, click on the talon. All cards
on the tableau will be re-shuffled.</p>
<p>Once during the game, any one card below the top of a fan may be
drawn out and used on foundations or fan builds. Do this by moving
the top card of the fan to the Draw pile.</p>
