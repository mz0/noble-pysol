<h1>Nomad</h1>
<p>Gypsy type. 2 decks. No redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Move all cards to the foundations.</p>
<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>Like <a href="gypsy.html">Gypsy</a>, but with one extra free
cell.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>The eight playing piles in the tableau all start with four cards
showing. Piles build down by alternate color, and an empty space
can be filled with any card or sequence. The single free cell at
the bottom may hold one card at a time.</p>
<p>When no more moves are possible, click on the talon. One card
will be added to each of the playing piles.</p>
<p>You are also permitted to move cards back out of the
foundation.</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>Making heavy use of the Undo key is explicitly encouraged here -
you can win many games with a little bit of thought. Keeping the
free cell open for sorting is usually a good idea.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>Nomad was created to be more strategic than Gypsy (hence all the
open cards), and be solvable more often than it under optimal play.
From empiric data, I find it's solvable in all but one in ten
games, where I was solving only slightly above a quarter of the
Gypsy games. At the same time, the single free cell gives it a very
rich complexity.</p>
