<h3>Object</h3>

Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
An ace of each color is dealt to two foundations, and cards
are dealt to eight tableau piles of six cards.  The remaining
two cards are dealt to two free reserve cells.
<p>
Tableau piles are built down by alternate color.  Any appropriate
sequence of cards can be moved between tableau piles, and any valid
card or sequence can be moved to an empty tableau pile.  Any single
card can be moved to/from one of the reserve cells.
<p>
The foundations are built up by alternate color, from ace to king,
and then wrapping around for a second sequence.  The game is won if
all cards are moved to the foundations.
