<h1>Osmium</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. Unlimited redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Just like <a href="osmosis.html">Osmosis</a>,
but all four foundations must be built in the same
sequence of ranks.  Additionally, the order of the
foundations doesn't matter and cards are dealt one
at a time from the stock.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Osmium is based on an altered version of the Osmosis
rules used in older versions of PySolFC.
