<h1>Algerian Patience</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
At the start of the game, one king in each suit is placed in the
rightmost of the eight foundations - these foundations are built
down by suit while the remaining foundations are built up by suit,
starting with an ace.
<p>
The tableau piles start with eight cards dealt, and six reserve
stacks of four cards each are also dealt.  The tableau piles are built
up or down by same suit, though only one card can be moved at a time.
Cards from the reserve may be moved to tableau piles or foundations,
but not other reserve piles.  Any card may be played in an empty space
on the tableau.
<p>
When play comes to a standstill, you can deal two cards to each of the
reserve piles from the stock.  When there are only eight cards left in
the stock, you instead deal one of those cards to each tableau stack.
<p>
The game is won if all the cards are moved to the foundations.
