<h1>Montana</h1>
<p>Montana type. 1 deck. 2 redeals.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Group all the cards in sets of 12 cards in acscending sequence
by suit from Two to King.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>This solitaire starts with the entire deck shuffled and dealt
out in four rows. The Aces are then removed making 4 initial free
spaces. You may move to a space only the card that matches the left
neighbor in suit, and is one greater in rank. Kings are high, so no
cards may be placed to their right (they create dead spaces).</p>
<p>When no moves can be made, cards still out of sequence are
reshuffled and dealt face up after the ends of the partial
sequences, leaving a card space after each sequence, so that each
row looks like a partial sequence followed by a space, followed by
enough cards to make a row of 13.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>A moment's reflection will show that this game cannot take more
than 12 redeals. But only 2 redeals are allowed...</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>This game is also known under names such as <i>Gaps</i>.</p>
