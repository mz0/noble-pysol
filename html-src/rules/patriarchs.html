<h1>Patriarchs</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
At the start of the game, an ace and king of each
suit is dealt to the foundations, and a card is dealt to
each of nine reserves.  Cards cannot be moved between
reserves, but reserve cards can be moved to the foundations.
The foundations with the aces are built up by same suit
from ace to king, while the foundations with the kings are
built down by same suit from king to ace.  Empty reserve
cards are immediately replaced from the waste pile.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can draw cards one at a time
from the talon, and move them to the foundations if possible.
You are allowed one redeal, so you can go through the talon
twice.  The game is won if all cards are moved to the
foundations.
