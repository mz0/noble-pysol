<h1>Retinue</h1>
<p>FreeCell type. 2 decks. No redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Move all cards to the foundations.</p>
<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>Like <a href="freecell.html">FreeCell</a>, but with 2 decks, and
empty rows are not filled.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>All cards are dealt to 8 piles at the start of the game, each
King starting a new pile. To compensate for this there are 8 free
cells which can hold any - and just one - card.</p>
<p>Piles build down by alternate color, and an empty space cannot
be filled.</p>
<p>The number of cards you can move as a sequence is restricted by
the number of free cells - the number of free cells required is the
same as if you would make an equivalent sequence of moves with
single cards.</p>
