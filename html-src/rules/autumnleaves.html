22 cards are dealt in six columns.  The tableau piles are built down
by suit, but a card may be placed on any card of the same suit but a
higher rank, even if the ranks are not consecutive.  However, a
group of cards can only be moved as a sequence if the ranks are
consecutive.

added to each of the playing piles.

The game is won when all the cards are dealt into four sequences of
the same suit, descending from King to Ace.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Autumn Leaves was invented by Toby Ord, and the name comes from how
the cards can flutter between the stacks.  More details can be found
