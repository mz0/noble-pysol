<h1>King's Audience</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Sixteen cards are dealt in a square, forming a tableau called
the "antechamber".  No building on these tableau piles is allowed.
<p>
There are two rows of foundations.  Each foundation in the top row
just receives a King and Queen of the same suit, both of which must
be played together when both cards are available (in PySol, move one
appropriate card to the other in the tableau, and they will both
automatically be moved to the correct foundation).  The bottom row
of foundations is started with an ace and Jack of the same suit,
played in a similar manner, but with the Jack on top.  Then, they're
built down by same suit from Jack to two.
<p>
Empty piles in the antechamber are filled from the waste pile, or
the talon if the waste is empty.  Cards can be dealt from the talon
one at a time to the waste pile - no redeal is allowed.  The game
is won if all cards are moved to the foundations.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
The name of the game comes from the fact that the lower foundation
cards - the Jacks with their entourages - end up adjacent to the Kings
and Queens as if having an audience with them.
<p>
The game also goes by the name Queen's Foundation.  In some variations,
depending on which name is used, either the King or Queen is placed on
top in the king-queen foundations.
