<h1>Locked Cards</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="topsyturvyqueens.html">Topsy-Turvy Queens</a>,
but the foundations are built more traditionally, from ace to
king of the same suit.  Also, tableau piles are built down by
alternate color, and there are five cards in each pile at the
start of the game.
