<h1>Corner Suite</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>

Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Cards are dealt from the stock one at a time, and can be
moved to one of nine tableau piles, which are built down by
rank, regardless of suit, with only the top card visible.
Though single cards can be moved between tableau piles,
empty piles can only be filled from the waste pile.  No
redeal is allowed.
<p>
The foundations, located in the corners of the game, are
built up by same suit from ace to king.  The game is won
if all cards are moved to the foundations.
