<h1>Der kleine Napoleon</h1>
<p>Napoleon type. 1 deck. No redeal.</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>Move all cards to the foundations.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>This game is somewhat harder and requires thoughtful
strategy.</p>
<p>The layout consist of 4 foundations in the middle, 8 row stacks
(4 on each of the left and right side), 2 reserve stacks (one on
each of the left and right side), and a free cell in the
middle.</p>
<p>The row stacks and reserve stacks grow from the middle and are
laid out open, but only the outer card is in play.</p>
<p>The foundations build either up or down in suit, depending on
the first card you play there. They wrap around from King to Ace
and Ace to King.</p>
<p>The 8 row stacks build both up and down in suit, also wrapping
around. Only a single card can be moved, and free rows can be
filled with any single card.</p>
<p>There is no building on the 2 reserve stacks. Cards can only be
moved to other stacks from there.</p>
<p>Finally there is one extra free cell that can hold any single
card. But to move a card back from the free cell at least one of
the two "blocking" reserve stacks must have been cleared.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Try <a href="derfreienapoleon.html">Der freie Napoleon</a> if
you have troubles understanding the rules - it is the exactly same
game in a different layout.</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>Decide carefully if you build the foundations up or down.</p>
<p>Getting a free row stack should be one of your highest
priorities.</p>
