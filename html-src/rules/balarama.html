<h1>Balarama</h1>
Dashavatara Ganjifa type. One deck. No redeal.

The cards build down by rank in alternate colors on the tableau, no
more than twelve to a row. Any card or sequence may be played on an
empty row.

All cards are dealt to the sixteen rows when the games begins.
Cards on the tableau build down in rank in alternating colors. See
the general <a href="../ganjifa.html">Ganjifa</a> card rules for
information on that. The foundations build up by suit. Any card or
sequence may be played on an empty row. The four reserve stacks
hold one card each.

An empty row is more useful than the reserve stacks. Try for an
empty row.
