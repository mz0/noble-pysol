Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
Eight cards are dealt to form eight tableau piles.  These
tableau piles are built by alternate color.  A card may be
moved to a tableau pile if it is the same rank or one rank
lower than the card it's placed on top of.  Any single card
or an entire pile can be moved, but partial tableau stacks
cannot be moved.  Any card or sequence can fill an empty
pile.
<p>
The top card of the talon is flipped face-up and can be moved
to any valid tableau or foundation pile.  No further cards
from the talon can be viewed until after the current card
has been moved.
<p>
The foundations are built up by same suit from ace to king.
The game is won if all cards are moved to the foundation.
