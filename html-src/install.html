<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>There is no need to compile anything since the whole program is
just a Python script. Just run it, and that's all.</p>
<p>PySol requires Python 2.3 and Tcl/Tk 8.4 or better. Both
packages are freely available for Unix, Windows and Macintosh
platforms.</p>
<p>PySol is free <i>Open Source</i> software distributed under the
terms of the <a href="license.html">GNU GPL</a>.</p>
<h2>Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000</h2>
PySol now ships as a completely self-contained setup file, so
there's no need to install anything else.
<p>If you want to modify the PySol source code or write your own
Python programs you can get the development system from <a href=
"http://www.python.org/download/download_windows.html">http://www.python.org/download/download_windows.html</a></p>
<h2>Unix</h2>
There are good chances that your system already ships with Python
and Tcl/Tk.<br />
Otherwise visit <a href=
"http://www.python.org/download/">http://www.python.org/download/</a>
for full source code.
<p>Also, installable packages exist for all major Linux
distributions, FreeBSD and HPUX.</p>
<h2>Macintosh</h2>
Self installing exectuables for Python and Tcl/Tk are available
from<br />

<p>As I don't have access to a Mac I'd appreciate any detailed
feedback on installation and look &amp; feel. "Porting" from X11 to
Windows only required some minor changes in the default font
settings, so I hope the situation on Macs is similar.</p>
<p>[ I have been told that PySol works fine on a Mac - just drop
"pysol.py" on the Python interpreter and that's it. But for some
reason you must assign a large amount of memory to the Python
interpreter. ]</p>
