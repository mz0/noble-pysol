<h1>Plugins</h1>
<p>
PySolFC can support adding additional games, or making other modifications
by writing Python scripts that work as plugins.  These scripts can be added
to the plugins folder of your user folder or the PySolFC installation directory.
Plugins can be used to create and add games that are too complex for the
<a href='solitaire_wizard.html'>Solitaire Wizard</a> options.
<p>
A couple sample plugins are available for download on the PySolFC website
<a href='https://sourceforge.net/projects/pysolfc/files/Sample%20Plugins/'>here</a>.
These plugins recreate a couple of PySol's more complex games, including
<a href='rules/demonsandthieves.html'>Demons and Thieves</a> and
<a href='rules/crossword.html'>Crossword</a> and can be used as a guide to
help write your own plugins.
