<h1>Curds and Whey</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>Curds and Whey is a solitaire card game which uses a deck of 52
playing cards. Invented by David Parlett, this game belongs to the
family of solitaire games that includes Spider and Scorpion.</p>
<p>The cards are dealt into 13 piles (or columns) of four cards
each. The top card of each pile is available for play.</p>
<p>There are no foundations in this game; the object is to form
four suit sequences each running from King down to Ace.</p>
<p>A card can be built in only two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over a card that is of the same suit and of a higher rank,
or</li>
<li>Over a card that is of the same rank but of a different
suit.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the 8 of spades can be built over the 9 of spades
or any other 8 (such as the 8 of clubs).</p>
<p>One card can be moved at a time unless a sequence has been made.
If a sequence of cards follows either one of the following two
guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sequences that are built down by suit</li>
<li>Sequences of cards with the same rank</li>
</ul>
...it can be moved as a unit in part or in whole. However, a
sequence that follows both guidelines at once must be rearranged to
follow only one guideline before moving as a unit.
<p>When a column becomes empty, it can only be filled by a King or
a sequence starting with a King.</p>
<p>The game is won when the object above is fulfilled, forming four
suit sequences each running from King down to Ace.</p>
