<h1>Intrigue</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>Intrigue is a solitaire card game which is played using two
decks of playing cards. It is similar to another solitaire game of
<a href="saliclaw.html">Salic Law</a>, but it also involves the
queens and building in the foundations goes both ways.</p>
<p>First, one queen is removed from the rest of the deck is placed
on the layout as the base for the first tableau column.</p>
<p>As they become available, all fives and sixes are placed at the
foundations above the queens. The fives are built down to Aces,
then to Kings while the sixes are built up to Jacks, all regardless
of suit.</p>
<p>Over the first queen, the cards are dealt over it until another
queen appears. This new queen becomes the base for a new tableau
column and cards are dealt over it. This is repeated until all
eight queens are uncovered and all cards are deal.</p>
<p>During the dealing, all fives and sixes are immediately placed
in the foundations and any card that be built on the foundations
must be placed there.</p>
<p>Once all cards are dealt and all those that can be built in the
foundations make their way there, building continues. The top cards
of each column is available for play on the foundations. A column
containing only a queen is considered empty and any card can be
placed on it. There is no building in the tableau.</p>
<p>The game is won when all cards are build on the foundations with
the face cards on top.</p>
<h3>Variations</h3>
<p>Below are harder variations of Intrigue:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <b>Laggard Lady</b>, the fives and sixes may not be moved
faster then the queens. Therefore, for example, if there are five
queens dealt so far, a sixth five or a sixth six must be dealt to
the tableau.</li>
<li>In <b>Glencoe</b>, each five and six must be placed over the
queen of its respective suit. If the appropriate queen is not yet
available at a time a five or six appears, that five or six must be
dealt to the tableau.</li>
</ul>
