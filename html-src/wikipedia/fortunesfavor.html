<h1>Fortune's Favor</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>Fortune's Favor is a solitaire card game which is playing with a
deck of 52 playing cards. It is so-called probably because the
chances of winning are completely on the player's side.</p>
<p>First, the four aces are removed from the deck and placed in a
row to form the bases of the foundations. These foundations are
built up by suit to kings.</p>
<p>Below the foundations, two rows of six cards each (or any
preferred arrangement of twelve cards) are dealt. These form the
bases of the twelve tableau piles. The top cards on the tableau
piles are available for building on the foundations and on the
tableau. Building in the tableau is down by suit and spaces which
result in moving a card is filled from the wastepile or, if there
is none, the stock. Only one card can be moved at a time.</p>
<p>The stock, when play goes on a standstill, is dealt one card at
a time onto a wastepile, the top card of which is available for
play on the tableau or foundations.</p>
<p>The game is won when all cards are built onto the
foundations.</p>
