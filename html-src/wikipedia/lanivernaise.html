<h1>La Nivernaise</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>La Nivernaise or just Nivernaise (also known as Napoleon's
Flank) is an older version of <a href=
"tournament.html">Tournament</a>. It is played exactly as
Tournament except the six columns of four cards each are just piles
with only their top cards exposed. Here, the reserve is the "flank"
while the piles are the "line."</p>
