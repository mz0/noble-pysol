<h1>Baroness</h1>
<h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
<p>Baroness is a solitaire card game that is played with a deck of
52 playing cards. Also known as <b>Five Piles</b> and
<b>Thirteens</b>, it is a game that has an arrangement that is
almost like that of Aces Up but with the game play of Pyramid.</p>
<p>Five cards are dealt in a row; they will form the bases of the
five piles, the top cards of which are available for play.</p>
<p>In order to win, one has to remove Kings and pairs of cards that
total 13. In this game, spot cards are taken at face value, Jacks
value at 11, Queens 12, and Kings 13. So the following combinations
of cards are discarded:</p>
<ul>
<li>Queen and Ace</li>
<li>Jack and 2</li>
<li>10 and 3</li>
<li>9 and 4</li>
<li>8 and 5</li>
<li>7 and 6</li>
<li>Kings on their own.</li>
</ul>
<p>When gaps occur, they are filled by the top cards of the other
piles; but when there are not enough cards to do this (less than
five), cards from the stock are used.</p>
<p>When gaps are filled and no kings and/or pairs of cards
totalling 13 are present, five new cards are dealt from the stock,
one onto each pile. Game play then continues, with the top cards of
each pile, as mentioned above, are available. This cycle of
discarding and dealing of new cards goes on until the stock has
been used up.</p>
<p>The game is successfully won when all cards have been
discarded.</p>
